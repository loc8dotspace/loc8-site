Many food hubs function as simple points of transit for produce from the farmer to the purshaser. Facilitating a hub can help your budget by 10-15% depending upon the hub-farmer agreements reached.


## A well appreciated history of restorable hardware items

Many projects are just waiting to come together into action. The simple art of facilitating a good connection is the entire goal of TJY. We can do it.

>Our most important resource is the ingenuity we share.


## What you need to know before committing to running a hub or when deciding to seek funding for conducting a healthy food consumption before and after family study

The community is depending upon you. By using this software you agree to treat other members with due respect, arrive on time, notify the group for changes or loss/ damage/ changes to any deliveries or dropoffs.  The network is here to help you in times of incliment weather, and to help you construct additional insulated or heated / cooled storage as necessary and designed with resource efficiency in mind.

We are working on the software for both simultaneously, so the crossover aspects are a key element we make use of in delivering features to the OFN Lite and the Tiny Junkyard Systems.
